-	What tones, sounds, settings make sense given your data? How do different choices affect the meaning of what you’ve created? Is there anything meaningful? Save your music and your notes/thoughts on making it, to your repository.
-	I switched to the weather report one to see and the sound went up as the graph went up
-	Even when I change the instrument, the notes can be recognized …. It influence the feel, the piono feel softer compared to the mandolin

-	Leaflet 
-	Had a trouble with setting up the web-map into a directory
