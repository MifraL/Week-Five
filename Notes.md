Sound 

1. Podcasting

- I live using audacity, it was easier to use then I expected.
- I just don't like how my voice sounds...

2. Sonification

-	I switched to the weather report one to see and the sound went up as the graph went up. I believe rather than it being music, it more like patterns that could be identified using sound. 
-	Even when I change the instrument, the notes can be recognized â€¦. It influence the feel, the piono feel softer compared to the mandolin

-	Had a trouble with setting up the web-map into a directory, but it worked finally when I used anaconda prompt.
-	Then I though, I made a mistake with my map as it was missing the overlapping map but it was because I was not there yet.

- It was a great tool. I had a bit of trouble getting it to flow and finding a topic that would make sense. 
- I had changed the title but it was not shown... even when I saved and published the changes 
- So I copied the storymap and renamed it and it worked.

- I had an issue trying to do the poster with my essay using the template because it kept moving when I tried to select my texts
- Other than that, it was fairly easy to use
