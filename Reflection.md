Reading 1:Entries from last year’s DH Awards, under the ‘Best DH Data Visualization’, and the ‘Best DH Public Engagement’ winners, runners up, and nominees.

1.	https://ventesdantiques.inha.fr/
-	The stories about antiquities that haven’t been discovered before
-	The site is simple  and clear
-	In the discover a story tab, it has pictures to choose and learn from which I really like because then I can easily focus on the ones that I like and once you choose them theres a little blurb about what they are. I like how it is minimal with only the most important facts. 
-	I love the perfume vase like the Lecythe attique  and how detailed it is for something so small. 
-	It reminds me of the vases that I came across when I did Greek and Roman archeology.
-	In explore our date tab, it shows artworks and their location… I find it so fascinating. As for the protagonists, the things that they own and who is selling or buying them throughout the years and for how much. 
-	I really liked what they did with the values, it’s put in a graph with the dates and the amount of money it was bough for. The antiquities also cross each other if they have a connection. It’s really cool. 
 In continuity, two main research axes were developed combining the history of ancient art and the history of archeology, with the objective of developing studies and producing documentary resources. useful to the historiography and the history of the fortune of the antique, and likely to offer new or renewed foundations to the contemporary practices of the discipline. The opening of the estate to the history of ancient artproper affirms the fundamental complementarity between the discipline and the study of its history, the tools of analysis of the antiquarians and archaeologists allowing the identification or the definition of works as the evaluation of the forms of their reception and old interpretative categories.
Certain current research programs continue the study and the development of new sources (minutes from auction houses, albums of drawings from the antique), with particular attention paid to the development of digital tools allowing the exploitation archive data and visual data. Others are more directly related to the history of ancient art and archeology; a new program thus deals with an archaeological corpus from periods higher than those hitherto discussed, and will propose, based on the study of unpublished ceramic material from Syria, a new typological frame of reference.

-	The main objective of the project was to design and implement an open access web application that identifies, organises and classifies the content of historical representations of the island of Cyprus. Source: https://gaia.hua.gr/en/coastal_cyprus/
-	The representation are all based on maps so that the place can be located… 
-	With Cyprus as the main location, everything related wthere person, geographical features, representation (visual works)…. Are all shown based on where they are
	
3.	https://italian-paleography.library.utoronto.ca/
The Italian Paleography website presents 102 Italian documents and manuscripts written between 1300 and 1700, with tools for deciphering them and learning about their social, cultural, and institutional settings. The site includes:
-	digitized images of 102 manuscripts and documents;
-	T-Pen, a digital tool to actively transcribe manuscripts and documents;
-	transcriptions and background essays for each item;
-	a selection of calligraphy books and historical manuscript maps;
-	a handbook of Italian vernacular scripts;
-	additional resources, including a glossary, list of abbreviations and symbols, dictionaries, and teaching materials.
I liked the introduction to what paleography is because I was not familiar with the term…
-	the documents were given a detailed description as well as a small summary 
-	it is a great database for finding the basic data about Italian documents and manuscripts 

Reading 2: Cristina Wood. Song of the Ottawa. http://songsoftheottawa.ca/
-	I love how the author said that the computer is the composer for the songs of the Ottawa 
-	It is intriguing that almost 100 years of data can be complied into a 6 minutes song (hearing the river’s flow)
-	It’s edgier than I thought maybe because I associated river = soft and flowy, 
-	The sounds of industry is sonify an artifact through the 3D space that it occupies… 
-	My favorite of the songs is on the water, just from the sounds. It does sound like three files were layered on top of each other to produce this song because of how it sounds. 
-	I find the idea really intriguing and how sonification of the river’s past were used to create a pattern…

Reading 3: ‘The Ottawa River’s History Re-told in Musical Notes.’https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/
-	To tell the history of the Ottawa River, translates her research into musical notes of a piano.
-	A different approach rather than relying on visuals

Reading 4: Digital Panopticon 
-	Searching for convicts of Old Bailey ??? That is so surprising and the ways to identify them…
-	The informations found were concise and precise and it was simple to read for a quick summary
-	Found Sarah Durrant, the woman from the previous article
