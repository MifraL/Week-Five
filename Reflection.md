1.	https://ventesdantiques.inha.fr/

-	The site is simple  and clear. Out of all of them, I liked it the best. 
-	In the discover a story tab, it has pictures to choose and learn from which I really like because then I can easily focus on the ones that I like and once you choose them theres a little blurb about what they are. I like how it is minimal with only the most important facts. 

-	In explore our date tab, I find it so fascinating how the things that that people own can be tracked like who is selling or buying them throughout the years and for how much.

Reading 2: Cristina Wood. Song of the Ottawa. http://songsoftheottawa.ca/

-	I love how the author said that the computer is the composer for the songs of the Ottawa 
-	It is intriguing that almost 100 years of data can be complied into a 6 minutes song (hearing the river’s flow)
-	It’s edgier than I thought maybe because I associated river = soft and flowy, 
-	The sounds of industry is sonify an artifact through the 3D space that it occupies… 
-	My favorite of the songs is on the water, just from the sounds. It does sound like three files were layered on top of each other to produce this song because of how it sounds. 
-	I find the idea really intriguing and how sonification of the river’s past were used to create a pattern…

Reading 3: ‘The Ottawa River’s History Re-told in Musical Notes.’https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/

-	To tell the history of the Ottawa River, translates her research into musical notes of a piano.
-	A different approach rather than relying on visuals, it made think that rather than only focusing on the traditional research methods, historians should aim to create more diverse methods pertaining to the current time period. 

Reading 4: Digital Panopticon

-	The informations found were concise and precise and it was simple to read for a quick summary
