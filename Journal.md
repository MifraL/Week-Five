think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various sites and projects you explored this week. Tie what you find/observe to your own work. With regard to your own work, reflect on your design choices and the story you’re trying to tell, or the interesting thing you’ve found. 

Critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?


What had an impact on you and how you think of your own historian’s craft?
