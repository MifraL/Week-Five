think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various sites and projects you explored this week. Tie what you find/observe to your own work. With regard to your own work, reflect on your design choices and the story you’re trying to tell, or the interesting thing you’ve found. 

Critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?

In terms of effectiveness, I believe the podcasting is more personal and it can be highly relatable to the targeted audience. While, the poster is good but it is harder to see the whole picture because of the limit of a computer screen. Mapping is good but it can only be effective with maps. As for the static websites, they can be engaging but if there's too much of the moving images, it can be quite distracting. 

What had an impact on you and how you think of your own historian’s craft?

I think the one that had the most impact on me is sound because I like visuals a lot and I never would have considered using sound as a basis for my own craft. Even the research of the Songs of the Ottawa made me really impressed.
