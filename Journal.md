Critically evaluate the thing(s) you’ve made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?

-In terms of effectiveness, I believe the podcasting is more personal and it can be highly relatable to the targeted audience. While, the poster is good but it is harder to see the whole picture because of the limit of a computer screen. That would mean that the impact is restricted and minimized. Mapping is good but it can only be effective with research related to location. As for the static websites, they can be engaging but if there's too much of the moving images, it can be quite distracting. For me personnaly, I think all of them are useful but they would work better when using it for specific things like example mapping and storymap for creating links between location.

What had an impact on you and how you think of your own historian’s craft?

-I think the one that had the most impact on me is sound because I like visuals a lot and I never would have considered using sound as a basis for my own craft. Even the research of the Songs of the Ottawa made me really impressed with how the patters created from data could showcase a different story from the past by helping narrate a different point of view in the existing history.
